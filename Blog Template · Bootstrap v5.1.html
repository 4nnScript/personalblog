        <p>This blog is talking about my journey as a girl and a student who has lived for almost 22 years in a less professional way.
          I am going to talk about stuff in emotional and motivational ways, so I hope I do not make you cringe as you read :) Cheers!

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to start from high school as believe me, my formal education story is not that amusing. Anyway, in high school I was not a very active student.
          SMAN 3 Malang, or we call it Bhawikarsu is the best high school in Malang, it is well known with the intellectual students
          both academic, and non academic. However, I decided to just enjoy my high school time by hanging out with friends,
          and studying (lol) to make sure I have a strong foundation of knowledge for the higher education. 
          Even so, I still spared my times to join clubs I love such as japanese club and english club.</p>

            about his country. On the next picture, it was taken on 2018 when we just finished performing
            dance class in PCSC event. PSCS is the biggest event in Bhawikarsu, and my class was chosen to perform in it by
            doing some theatrical dancing with jugle theme! It was so fun, we trained almost everyday after school until 10pm 
            then I finally got typus :) I know. Great way to ruin the final performance Nisa! However, we still got a 
            great applauds, it feels amazing to be on the stage.</p>

        <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
        <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langage">HTML</abbr> should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
          <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>
        <h2>Heading</h2>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
        <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
        <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
