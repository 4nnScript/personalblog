        <p>Because everything starts with learning</p>
        <blockquote style="font-size: 90%;"class="blockquote">
          <b>SMA Negeri 3 Malang.</b>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to start from high school as believe me, my formal education story is not that amusing. Anyway, in high school I was not a very active student.
          SMAN 3 Malang, or we call it Bhawikarsu is the best high school in Malang, it is well known with the intellectual students
          both academic, and non academic. However, I decided to just enjoy my high school time by hanging out with friends,
          and studying (lol) to make sure I have a strong foundation of knowledge for the higher education. 
          Even so, I still spared my times to join clubs I love such as japanese club and english club.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <div>
            <img src="ryouhei.jpg" width= "40%" height="40%" style="margin-right: 2rem; margin-left: 2rem; border: 5px solid #6384a2">
            <img src="smanti.jpg" width= "40%" height="40%" style="border: 5px solid #6384a2"">
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"> The first picture was me and Ryouhei-san, he is Japanese who visited our Japanese club. He did a little presentation
            about his country. On the next picture, it was taken on 2018 when we just finished performing
            dance class in PCSC event. PSCS is the biggest event in Bhawikarsu, and my class was chosen to perform in it by
            doing some theatrical dancing with jugle theme! It was so fun, we trained almost everyday after school until 10pm 
            then I finally got fever :) I know. Great way to ruin the final performance Nisa! However, we still got a 
            great applauds, it feels amazing to be on the stage.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">This was actually the first competition I tried joining during college. My friend and I was 
        just doing it for fun, trying out our luck. We were making idea of an application integrated with AI to boost 
      users motivation to study. A funny story, D-1 we were staying up so late to finish our presentation materials.
    I went to sleep at 1am and we had to be present in Zoom Meeting at 7am. Stupidly, I fell asleep until 8 am :( My team mate contacted
  allllll my family member, she even video call my sister through instagram... It was really horrible but somehow we made it through :)</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I would say this competition worth the effort. We were proposing a website for hospitals and PMI to support
        demand of convalesent plasma. We proposed this idea for PKM, and we stopped in "pendanaan" phase. However, 
      we see the potential of this idea, so we register it through BRI business competitions by giving some improvement. 
    Yet we stopped in the semifinal. A week later, one of my team mate, saw UT INTECH competition and we again tried to propose the same idea
  and evaluated it based on prev competition feedback. Long story short, we were given some fund to create the website. We stayed up late
almost everyday, even during weekend. Finally we made it :) Even though we only celebrated online, it was really heart warming :)</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">You know what's funny, people tend to be grouping with people who has same common. So, if you want to make someone 
      your friend, then ask them to go to a foreign place with you and you'll get along. United People Global, is an international organization. Among more than 4000 applicants
    they accepted 500 only, and there are only 6 Indonesian people exist. I never felt more bonded to Indonesian who I practically just met.
  It is very amusing, being in a such diverse place. Even though it is just online, we learnt well, and laughed good :)</p>
